Custom view HTML page for Ontime timers. Replicates the way LIFE currently uses ProPresenter7 cue screen display.
The Ontime application will serve this page if it is placed in the correct location.

To use, download the HTML file and move it into a folder inside the /external folder in the application directory.
For PC users:
AppData/Roaming/Ontime/external/{your folder name here}/index.html

For Mac users:
Macintosh HD/Users/{username}/Library/Application Support/Ontime/external/{your folder name here}/index.html (you may have to show hidden folders to navigate here) 

 For example, I have created a folder in this directory called "cuescreen" 

 The index.html file is placed inside this folder.
 The page can then be accessed at http://ip-address:4001/external/cuescreen
